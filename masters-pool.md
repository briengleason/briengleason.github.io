## Rules:
* Each participant will choose six players from six tiers based on the current World Golf Rankings.
* Out of your six picks, your top four scores will count towards your weekend total.
* At the end of the weekend, whichever participant has the lowest four player score will win the pot. 
    * If there's a tie, the winner will be determined by the participant who has the highest placing finisher on their roster. 
    * If that's a tie, we'll work down the roster until someone has a higher finisher. 
    * If you're still tied after running through the entire roster, you'll just split the pot.
* Players who do not make the cut will receive a score of 80 (+8) for both Saturday and Sunday. For tiebreaker purposes, all players who don't make the cut will count as the same place.
